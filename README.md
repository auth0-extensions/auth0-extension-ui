# Auth0 Extension UI

Add your components to `src/components` and stories that will appear in storybook (e.g `InputText.js` contains the component and `InputText.stories.js` has the stories).

# Run storybook
`npm run storybook`

# Adding tests to your components
Simply add them to `tests` folder with `specs.js` extension. `npm test` will run them all.

# Additional notes
Auth0 styles were added in [.storybook/head.html](https://github.com/auth0-extensions/auth0-extension-ui/tree/master/.storybook/head.html).
